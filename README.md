# didspeech
Transcribe an audio file.
This program allow you to transcribe an audio file.
Idea born by a need of a my friend, a non-tech lass, so it have to be simple to use.

# Troubles
I know, now it is a little bit confused, but it's an alpha, a fast-write code.

# TODO
- Split main program in module to well design
- Fix argument parsing in command line mode
- Merge multi_thread and not-multi_thread
- In gui, set a default start and end
- In gui, in start and end, a way to simplify it
- Make gui more beautiful
- More options either in gui and command line
